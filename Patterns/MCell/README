These patterns are from my old MCell collections, created in 2001-2002. 
Two collections are for my own rules I've invented back then. These two
rules were inspired by the well-known rule Starwars; They also belong to
the Generations rule family and behave similar to Starwars:

1. 3456/2678/5 

I attempted to build some logic circuitry for this
rule, but after a few experiments had abandoned it for the second one:

2. 34568/2678/6

This rule is less explosive and easier to manage than Starwars.
However, after building some logic gates, flip-flops and various cool 
patterns, I had soon abandoned it too for Fireworld.
Now, after converting these old MCell patterns into .rle format, 
I've renamed this rule Stargates.

The Rules directory at the root of this Github repository contains Golly
tables for the following rules from the original MCell:

Cars
Cheops
Crawlers
Ladders

These rules belong to the "Rules table" family specific to MCell.

Also included are archives of the original MCell backup and of the
converted Golly patterns.

Enjoy!
